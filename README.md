# Reflection Questions - Justin

1. I did well on filling missing data and using all four imputers from SkLearn.

2. The most challenging part was creating a survival analysis in the end.

3. If I had some knowledge of StatsModels or survival analysis, it would have been better.

4. I would need help in plotting the regression line and other plots using lifelines.
