# Reflection Questions - Justin
**What do I believe I did well on this assignment?**  
I did well on filling missing data and using all four imputers from SkLearn.

**What was the most challenging part of this assignment?**  
The most challenging part was creating a survival analysis in the end.

**What would have made this assignment a better experience?**  
If I had some knowledge of StatsModels or survival analysis, it would have been better.

**What do I need help with?**  
I would need help in plotting the regression line and other plots using lifelines.

# Reflection Questions - Daniel
**What do I believe I did well on this assignment?**  
I did well on saving results (`accuracy`, `precision`, `recall`, `f1`, `rSquared`, and `AUC`) from each model run. This is presented in a nicely formatted table at the end of `Logistic_Regression` notebook.  

**What was the most challenging part of this assignment?**  
This, for me, was implementing Survival Regression. This was particularly hard because I was expecting a variable that measures time. Some $R^2$'s were negative or very low for some models generated by `SkLearn`. Upon further research, I found that this is a known issue. Typically, we would expect $R^2$ and adjusted $R^2$ between 0 and 1.

**What would have made this assignment a better experience?**  
`Statsmodel` being able to have Lasso, Ridge, and ElasticNet Regularization working properly.

**What do I need help with?**   
Deeper dive into Survival Analysis as a whole and also the implementation with `lifelines`.
